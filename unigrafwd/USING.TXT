USING THE UNIVERSAL GRAPHICS IMPORT FILTER

1) Build and register a COM EXE Server with the following characteristics:

   (NOTE:  A trivial test server has been designed for you, see
    Test\Test.dsw.  The build process for that server will perform
	automatic registration).

   Progid:		Unigrafwd.Server

   Methods:		Convert
				-------

				Arguments:

						Type		Suggested Name		Purpose
						----		--------------		-------
						VT_BSTR		Path				Path of file to be converted

						VT_BSTR		Scrap				Filter wants 16-bit Windows metafile
														data to be stored in this path
						
						VT_I4		Resolution			Resolution of resulting metafile in pixels per inch
														suggested by filter.   Your server
														may choose differently. 

						VT_I4		Top					Top coordinate of resulting metafile
														clipping rectangle suggested by filter.   
														Your server may choose differently.

						VT_I4		Left				Left coordinate

						VT_I4		Bottom				Bottom coordinate

						VT_I4		Right				Right coordinate

				Result:

						VT_I4							Status of conversion.  Zero for
														success, non-zero otherwise.



				Top
				---

				Arguments:

						None

				Result:

						VT_I4							Server's idea of the top coordinate
														of resulting metafile clipping rectangle.
														Ignored when value < 0

				Left
				----

				Arguments:

						None

				Result:

						VT_I4							Server's idea of the left coordinate
														of resulting metafile clipping rectangle.
														Ignored when value < 0

				Bottom
				------

				Arguments:

						None

				Result:

						VT_I4							Server's idea of the bottom coordinate
														of resulting metafile clipping rectangle.
														Ignored when value <= 0

				Right
				-----

				Arguments:

						None

				Result:

						VT_I4							Server's idea of the bottom coordinate
														of resulting metafile clipping rectangle.
														Ignored when value <= 0

				Resolution
				----------

				Arguments:

						None

				Result:

						VT_I4							Server's idea of the resolution
														of resulting metafile.
														Ignored when value <= 0

				Cleanup
				-------

				Arguments:

						VT_BSTR		Scrap				Path of the scrap file that
														filter wants server to delete.

														The filter cannot do it, as 
														the thread belonging to Word 
														appears to be closed off from 
														normal file IO operations.


2) Calling sequence of server by filter:

   status = Convert    (Path, Scrap, Resolution, Top, Left, Bottom, Right)
   number = Resolution ()
   number = Top        ()
   number = Left       ()
   number = Bottom     ()
   number = Right      ()
   status = Cleanup    (Scrap)



3) General filter/server interaction:

   a) User attempts to insert a picture from file into Word document,
      or Word encounters a link to a file.

   b) Word calls correct filter for file type (by extension)

   c) This filter passes the path of the file to be converted, the path
      of the scrap file that filter expects the server to save results to,
	  and suggestions for resolution and clipping rectangle.

   d) The server will either construct the file and return a zero status
	  for success, or find some problem and return a nonzero status.

   e) The filter will fail upon encountering a nonzero status from the
      server, preventing Word from performing the picture insertion.

   f) The filter will call the server's methods for suggestions by the
      server on what the actual resolution and clipping rectangle actually was.

   g) The filter will copy the scrap into a memory handle for forwarding
      to Word.

   h) The filter will call the server to request that the server delete the
      scrap.

   i) The filter will forward to Word the metafile memory handle along with 
      clipping rectangle and resolution.

   j) Word will insert the image contained by the metafile memory handle.
