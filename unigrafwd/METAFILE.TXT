RECOMMENDATIONS CONCERNING COMPATIBLE METAFILE FORMATS


1) Do not use placeable, clipboard, or extended metafiles,
   simply use the Windows Metafile Format with original header.
2) When constructing the file, use only the older, 16 bit
   Windows GDI calls.
3) When constructing the file, be sure to set mapping mode 
   to anisotropic.
4) When constructing the file, be sure to set maximum x and
   y extents.
5) Highly recommend no more than one each of pen, font, text,
   text color, and background open at any given moment.


A sample metafile known to be working, fulltest.wmf, was taken 
from the open source libwmf project.  The placeable header
was stripped away from this to make a windows metafile having
only the original header.
